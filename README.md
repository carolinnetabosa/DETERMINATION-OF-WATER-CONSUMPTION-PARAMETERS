DETERMINATION OF WATER CONSUMPTION PARAMETERS: a case study in the Metropolitan Region of Recife, Northeast Brazil

Projects for water distribution systems, infrastructure rehabilitation, and sustainable management of water resources require accurate estimates of various data, such as water consumption. Determining this consumption is challenging and must consider variables such as climatic conditions, social standards, water availability, and water costs. This study analyzed the variation in water consumption in a Measurement and Control District (DMC) located in the Metropolitan Region of Recife, Northeast Brazil. The analysis included determining daily consumption curves and surveying minimum and maximum flow coefficients based on data collected every 15 minutes from April 2021 to April 2022. The study found that the maximum flow occurred at 12:15 pm, while the minimum flow was at 03:15 am. The results highlight the variability in water consumption throughout the day and night, and the discrepancy between the coefficients determined specifically for the district (k1=1.64; k2=1.3; k3=0.54) and the standardized values (k1=1.2; k2=1.5; k3=0.5), emphasizing the need for region-specific surveys.
